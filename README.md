# TPC
TPCFLib is a specialized Python library for accelerated computation of Two-Point Correlation Functions (TPCF) in 3D porous materials and microstructures. It provides significant performance improvements over conventional implementations through multi-backend support (PyTorch and JAX) and GPU acceleration.
